## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this exercice I did not learn much, but I builded some react muscle memory since I'm just a beginner in react.

### Continued development

I'm not really confident about my CSS skills yet, this is something that I want to improve in the future. I'm getting the hang of React, starting to get faster at writing components and I'm learning new things. I'm also learning new things about the frontend development process, like defining components and writing them.

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) - This helped me start my FrontEnd development path. I really like the way they teach.
